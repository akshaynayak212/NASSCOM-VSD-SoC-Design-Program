# NASSCOM-VSD-SoC-Design-Program
Explore the ASIC design flow using tools like Openlane and the Google-Sky Water collaboration's 130nm process design kit (PDK). Led by industry leader Kunal Ghosh, this course equips with the skills to craft standard cells, navigate the Physical Design domain, and generate GDSII files.

 <b> Arduino Board: </b> The Arduino Microcontroller Board comprises various elements like the microprocessor, voltage regulator, I/O pins, and communication interfaces. The microprocessor, highlighted , acts as the brain, executing instructions and managing the board's functions. The below provided image shows an Arduino Microcontroller Board, with a specific focus on the Microprocessor (chip).

 There are three main components ,they are:
 
1) <b>Core</b>: Refers to the region where our complete logic will be implemented.

2) <b>Pads</b>:Through pads signals travel from external sources to chip or vice-versa.

3) <b>Die</b>: Refers to the entire area of the chip.
