# NASSCOM-VSD-SoC-Design-Program
Explore the ASIC design flow using tools like Openlane and the Google-Sky Water collaboration's 130nm process design kit (PDK). Led by industry leader Kunal Ghosh, this course equips with the skills to craft standard cells, navigate the Physical Design domain, and generate GDSII files.

###   Introduction to QFN-48 Package, chip, pads, core, die and IPs

**Aurdino Board**: The image below is an Aurdino Microcontroller Board. Here we focus more on the encircled area, which contains the 'Microprocessor',that we will be designing from abstract level till fabrication level by using RTL to GDS flow

While we cosider the chip, there are 3 main components:

(1) Pads : Through these pads signals can travel into the chip from external sources and viceversa.

(2) Die : It is the whole area of the chip that will be manufactured on the silicon wafer.

(3) Core : It is the area where our entire logic will be implemented.
